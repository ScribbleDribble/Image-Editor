Stuff to do

Bugs:
UNRESOLVED
    - First point when creating a line isn't recognised. You will have to click on two more points for a line creation
    - When drawing stuff on the canvas, it downscales image size to the size of the canvas
	Possible fix: change canvas size back to file size when saving the image.
	- If you fill a shape and then draw a shape with a different colour, the former reverts back to its original colour
	- By double clicking on the canvas once fill has been activated, it will crash the program :( You must click once.
    - You can still paint after selecting another shape to draw with

UNHANDLED ERRORS
    - Finalising edge detection filter generates a a NullPointerException
    - When the user selects a filter in the menu without previously opening an image generates an error. Can easily be handled
