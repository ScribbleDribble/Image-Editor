Stuff to do

Bugs:
UNRESOLVED
    - first point when creating a line isn't recognised. You will have to click on two more points for a line creation
    - when drawing stuff on the canvas, it downscales image size to the size of the canvas
	Possible fix: change canvas size back to file size when saving the image.

UNHANDLED ERRORS
    - Finalising edge detection filter generates a a NullPointerException
    - When the user selects a filter in the menu without previously opening an image generates an error. Can easily be handled
